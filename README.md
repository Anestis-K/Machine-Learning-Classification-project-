<h1>Machine Learning Classification model </h1>
<h2>Project goal </h2>
<p>In this project i tried to develop a Machine Learning Classification model with R<br>
where the algorithm based on some characteristics( such as petal width and length) <br> would classify the species of the flower iris. </p>
<h3>Libraries and general information
<p>The model was developed in RStudio Cloud obviously with the R Programming language.
The libraries i used :
<ul>
<li>library (caret)</li>
<li>library (tidyverse)</li>
<li>library (kernlab)</li>
<li>library (e1071)</li></ul></h3>
